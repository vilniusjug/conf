        <p>
          Do you want to build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) using Java?
          We built LangChain4j exactly for that! The framework allows you to easily create AI-powered chatbots, process loads of unstructured data, and automate processes with the help of AI Services, that can use various tools: call APIs, access databases, and even dynamically execute generated code. You will get a hands-on guided tour through LangChain4j's functionality and its integrations (OpenAI, Google Gemini, HuggingFace, Dall-E, Quarkus, Spring Boot, etc.). We will explain the fundamental building blocks of LLM-powered applications and show you how to chain them together into AI Services. By the end of this session, you will have all the technical knowledge to start coding, along with plenty of inspiration for designing the new generation of apps.
        </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanvila/">Johnatan Vila</a> - <b>AI & Clean Code, is it worth it?</b></p>
      <p>As developers, we participate every day in our software life cycle adding new logic, adapting the existing one, and integrating with services or platforms.
        But, do we put the same effort into making software robust, maintainable, consistent, secure, clear, and tested?
        In this session, I will show the need for good practices in Clean Code along with the issues of not using it, showing concepts like Clean As You Code (CAYC) using free and open-source tools.
        Clean Code goes beyond the produced software and its programming language. Is a fundamental part of a developer's role growth, something that represents us no matter the language and the company where we work. Do not lose the thread.

      <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ewanslater/">Ewan Slater</a> - <b>App - ocalypse now</b></p>
      <p>One of the key concepts behind the rise of cloud is the efficient use of shared resources.  Everything you need, nothing you don't.
        But over a decade after cloud became mainstream, organisations are struggling to deliver value from cloud environments, because we're not building our apps efficiently and we're not running them efficiently.
        In this talk, I'll discuss these challenges and what we can do as Java developers and architects to try to address them.

      <p>
        For some time now JSON has been the preferred format for exchanging data between client (browsers) and servers. Often times developers had to configure data marshalling options to transform data into business objects, into persistent data, and back again. Perhaps it would make more sense to use JSON across the business pipeline without sacrificing performance nor missing benefits from the relational data world. this is what JSON Duality Views propose. In this session we'll explore options to enhance data driven applications written with Spring Boot, Quarkus, and Micronaut, enhancing your developer experience and increasing customer satisfaction.
